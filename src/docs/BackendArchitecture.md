# Backend Architecture for Risk Management Platform

## System Overview

This document describes the backend architecture for the Risk Management Platform. The system is designed to provide comprehensive risk analysis, simulation, and monitoring capabilities for organizations.

## Technology Stack

- **API Layer**: Node.js with Express.js or FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data and MongoDB for unstructured data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible storage for documents and reports
- **Background Processing**: RabbitMQ/Celery for asynchronous tasks
- **Deployment**: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Service

- User registration, login, and profile management
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Analyst, Viewer)
- Session management and JWT token handling
- Integration with SSO providers (optional)

### 2. Risk Data Management Service

- CRUD operations for risks, legislation items, news items
- Categorization and tagging system
- Data validation and sanitization
- Historical data tracking with versioning

### 3. Simulation Engine

- Monte Carlo simulation processing
- Risk distribution calculations
- Scenario management and comparison
- Performance optimization for complex simulations

### 4. Analytics Service

- Risk aggregation and statistical analysis
- Trend detection and forecasting
- Threshold monitoring and alerts
- Custom report generation

### 5. Notification Service

- Real-time alerts for critical risks
- Scheduled digest emails
- In-app notifications
- Customizable notification preferences

### 6. Document Management

- Storage and versioning of compliance documents
- OCR and text extraction for uploaded documents
- Document classification and tagging
- Document sharing with access control

## Data Models

Core data models are defined in the TypeScript type definitions and include:

- User and authentication data
- Risk data (categories, severity, responses)
- Simulation scenarios and results
- Legislation and news items
- Dashboard preferences and widgets
- Organization settings and configurations
- Products and clients

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are secured with JWT authentication
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning
- GDPR compliance for user data handling

## Deployment and Scaling

- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Database sharding for high-volume data
- Read replicas for improved query performance

## Monitoring and Observability

- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Performance monitoring with Grafana dashboards
- Alerting system for critical issues
- Health check endpoints for all services

## Integration Points

- External data sources for legislation updates
- News aggregation APIs
- Email service providers
- Document storage services
- SSO providers
- Export capabilities to Excel, PDF, etc.
